Cachet - Pluggable Caching for PHP
==================================

**This is no longer supported/maintained**

This library is deprecated and will no longer be supported beyond the
current version. The PHP landscape was very different when this was
created, and it is no longer a suitable choice for this task.

Please migrate to Symfony's cache module, or something similar:
https://packagist.org/packages/symfony/cache
